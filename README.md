# My dotfiles

## nvim

I use `kickstart.nvim` with a few customizations for key bindings.

## zellij

I've recently started using Zellij instead of tmux for terminal multiplexing.
For completeness, my old `.tmux.conf` file is included here as well.

## startship

I use starship for customizing my terminal prompt.

## kitty

I use kitty as my terminal emulator.
